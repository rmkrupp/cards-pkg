# Packaging Scripts

`linux_standalone/` contains the scripts to generate a portable compiled
version of the `cards` and `cards-client` repos.

Portable windows versions are the only kind supported, and generated directly
from the repos with the appropriate `configure.py` setting. In the future, a
wrapper to add in data and package them up nicely will exist here.
